(Requested by Angie on 10/2/2017)
Absences - by excused and unexcused - DONE
Absences - by special category (SWD, ELL, etc) - DONE
Absences - in regards to missing assignments. 

-- High Priority --
NOTE: When demoing to the Board, all reports should aggregate students - NO NAMES/IDs SHOULD BE RETURNED
Add a graphical way to show that there's a valid access token
Find a good way to set tests to use Dropbox vs. local
Return number values as numbers in the final results, so that they can be sorted correctly
Improved UI
Add button to save result table as .csv
Create tests for Reports using handmade data?

-- Medium Priority --
Add UI option to hide columns from result table
  Some tables could have tons of columns, give user option to hide ones they aren't interested in

-- Low Priority --
Add parameters to Report
   Student, grade, date range, etc.
   Can this be done with Angular filtering?
Allow aggregation by date range
