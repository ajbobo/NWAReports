-- High Priority --
Make a list of reports that are implemented
	Which are for 2016 vs 2017?
	What do we need for 2017 data?
AvgAttendanceByResource2017 needs to use 2017 SpEd data (see File Weirdness)
Break down Assignment report by Subject
Return number values as numbers in the final results, so that they can be sorted correctly
Create tests for Reports using handmade data?
NOTE: When demoing to the Board, all reports should aggregate students - NO NAMES/IDs SHOULD BE RETURNED - DONE
Refactor reports into a set of abstract high-level report classes, with subclasses for each specific year - DONE
	The abstract class has the behavior, the subclasses define the names and source files
Add "Hide PII" button - DONE

-- File weirdness --
SpecialProgramDetailByProgram contains all multiple types in a single sheet
	For 2016 data, we split it into multiple csv's (there was am xlsx with all 3)
	The only one we used was SpEd - This is the first group of data in the combined csv

-- Medium Priority --
Find a good way to set tests to use Dropbox vs. local
Improved UI
Add a graphical way to show that there's a valid access token
Add button to save result table as .csv
Add UI option to hide columns from result table
  Some tables could have tons of columns, give user option to hide ones they aren't interested in

-- Low Priority --
Add parameters to Report
   Student, grade, date range, etc.
   Can this be done with Angular filtering?
Allow aggregation by date range
