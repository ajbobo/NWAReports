Add DropBox login/integration to read the .csv files
Add filtering/sorting to the UI - can I do this with Angular?
   The Report object that is returned could include a list of columns that are available. Could this go into a dropdown?
Some csv files include last names as two words
   ElementaryReportCard has "Lozano Barron"
Add combination report - ex: Attendance+demographic
Add parameters to Report
   Student, grade, date range, etc.
   Can this be done with Angular filtering?
Allow aggregation by date range
